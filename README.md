#### By **Hannah Lee**

## Description

An algorithm written with Ruby using an anagram method to determine if a word is an anagram of another word.

#### Behavior
1. Check if two words are anagrams.
  * example input: "ruby" and "bury"
  * example output: "These words are anagrams."
2. Check if two words are anagrams but are in different cases.
  * example input: "Ruby" and "Bury"
  * example output: "These words are anagrams."
3. Check if two words are indeed words by having vowels.
  * example input: "abc" and "dfg"
  * example output: "Input words."
4. Check if two words have no matching letters and return they do not match and are antigrams.
  * example input: "Computer" and "Software"
  * example ouput: "These words have no letter matches and are antigrams."
5. Check if multiple words are anagrams.
  * example input: "William Shakespeare" and "I am a weakish speller"
  * example output: "These words are anagrams."
6. Check if words are palindromes.
  * example input: "Hannah" and "Hannah"
  * example output: These words are palindromes."
